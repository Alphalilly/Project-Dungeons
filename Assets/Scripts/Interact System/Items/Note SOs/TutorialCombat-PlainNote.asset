  message: "\tRules of Combat:\n\n        Weapons are unique, find the one that suits
    you. Left-click will swing your weapon to attack, watch out for enemy attacks!
    Right-click will block attacks, blocking an enemy attack will slightly increase
    the amount of time before they attack again. Once enemies are killed, they will
    drop any items they are holding; items will be needed for Captain Catastrophea"
